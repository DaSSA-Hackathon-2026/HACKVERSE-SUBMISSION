📌 HackVerse 2026 – GitHub Submission Guidelines

To ensure fair evaluation, technical rigor, and clarity across all teams, every HackVerse 2026 submission must follow a standardized repository structure and README format.

Your GitHub repository is not just code storage — it is part of your official evaluation.

Judges will review your repository to assess:

Depth of problem understanding

System architecture and design decisions

Modeling and AI strategy

Evaluation methodology

Business impact and actionability

Reproducibility and clarity

A well-structured repository demonstrates professionalism, technical maturity, and industry readiness.

🎯 Why This Structure Matters

HackVerse 2026 is an industry-collaborative hackathon. Sponsors are evaluating not only your model performance, but also:

Your ability to communicate technical decisions

Your ability to build explainable systems

Your ability to translate AI into business value

Your ability to document work professionally

In real-world industry settings, clear documentation and reproducibility are just as important as model accuracy.

🚨 Important Requirements

All teams must:

Follow the official repository naming convention

Use the required README structure below

Include architecture explanation

Include evaluation and metrics

Clearly explain business impact

Provide reproducible instructions

Incomplete or poorly structured repositories may impact scoring under:

Data & System Design

Modeling Strategy

Evaluation & Metrics

Business Actionability

🏆 Submission Philosophy

Your repository should answer this question clearly:

If an industry engineer or hiring manager reads this repository, can they understand what you built, why you built it, and how to reproduce it?

If the answer is yes — you are on the right track.
